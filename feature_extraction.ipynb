When name2 dies in a fall from a ladder, the elderly name3 is forced to move to Paris to live with her nephew Jean-Pierre. name3, believed by all to be gentle and kind, soon reveals her evil and domineering character and begins to mistreat the grandchildren for no reason, as she did with name2. Jean-Pierre's wife, the nice beautician name5, tries in every way to please her aunt and make her feel comfortable, but the woman repays her with all kinds of spite. Jean-Pierre's sister, the naive name6, is also constantly mocked by her aunt, who thinks she's an idiot.\\nDuring the summer, the name7ards, even to momentarily escape the unbearable presence of the aunt, leave for three weeks by going to a holiday village in Greece and leave the woman in the care of a young caregiver, name8. The girl initially tries to please the old woman by approving of her provocative behavior, but after a very short time the young woman decides to respond to name3 using her own ways; name8's strategy works and the old woman even falls in love with her, lending her money to repair her automobile and giving her the diamond pin coveted by her grandchildren. The relationship between the two, however, is strained when name8 tells name3 that she wants to spend a night on the beach with her new flame, the tourist name9. The elderly woman objects, the two fight furiously, and name8 leaves the house. To get revenge on everyone, Aunt name3 sets fire to the name7ard apartment and, once rescued, makes everyone believe that she was abandoned for months by her family. The name7ards are overwhelmed by the scandal and name3's story ends up in the news; exhausted by the misdeeds of the wicked old woman, the name7ards have no choice but to hospitalize her in a nursing home, where name3 continues to torment nurses and other elderly women. name5, however, is filled with guilt and often goes to visit her aunt, who shows no gratitude. One morning, the woman mysteriously disappears from the hospice, taking all her belongings with her and not letting the staff or the grandchildren know anything. This seems to be the ultimate disdain for all those who have tried to help her: in fact, name3 is reunited with name8 and the two women are happily enjoying a vacation around the world.\""
