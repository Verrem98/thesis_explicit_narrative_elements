       "\"name1 grows up as an Irish orphan in Cleveland, which is ruled by mob boss name2. Although he is bad at school, he knows how to assert himself. Again and again, his friends come to his aid. So he's working with them early in the docks. And after securing the post of union president by not entirely legal means, he marries the beautiful name3. Life seems to be getting better all the time, because not only is the family growing, but his reputation is rising, and business with the Mafia is getting better all the time. Unfortunately, journalist name4 collects enough evidence against name5 to go to name6 and have him arrested. But before name5 goes to prison, he makes a deal with the FBI to report on the business of organized crime at least once a month.\\nAnd even though name5's back in business as a loan shark's debt collector, he doesn't have much to report to the FBI. However, he and his wife have to move to an inferior neighborhood, adding to the strain on their marriage. And while the marriage ultimately breaks up, name5 is given the opportunity to gain a foothold in the garbage business if he manages to beat all the free garbage men either into the union or out of the business. The only time it becomes problematic for him is when his good friend name7 confronts him and refuses to work for the union. name5 wants to leave name7 alone, but under pressure from the mob, he changes his mind and puts a bomb in name7's house, so he freaks out, goes after him and shoots him multiple times. name5, however, fires back, killing him with the first bullet to the head. He was charged but later acquitted on grounds of self-defense.\\nHowever, name5 is not only known for his brutal intransigence, but also for his good-naturedness, which is why he is also known by the general population as the name8 Hood of name9wood. And since name5 can't work as a thug forever, he wants to open his own restaurant, The Dublin Public House. So he borrows $70,000 from the Gambinos with Birns' help. But unfortunately, the money never reaches name5 because the money courier wanted to buy six kilos of cocaine. And since name5 never received the money, he also refuses to pay it back, which is why he continues to demand the $70,000 from Birns. But he doesn't see the problem in himself, he sees the problem in name5, so when name5 refuses to pay, he hires a hit man and puts a car bomb in name5's car. But name5 evades the attempt, gets back at Birns in the same way, and kills him in the process.\\nBut despite all the problems, name5 manages to build his restaurant, and when it's really going well, the Mafia is already at the door, demanding 30% of all revenues from him as protection money. But when he refuses, the mob tries to kill him several times, throwing a bomb at his house and using a sniper on him while he jogs. But as he survives both attacks, he teams up with his old friend John Nardi and together they gradually eliminate more and more members of the Mafia, so that even the big families in New York doubt the competence of their relatives in Cleveland and send support. And name5 has almost no life left, because he lives in constant fear of being killed in an attack, so he offers the Mafia a deal. For $2 million, he's willing to leave Cleveland for good. But the mob hires another hit man, who keeps a close eye on him and gradually kills all of his friends before he ambushes name5. After a visit to the dentist, name5 returns to his car. In the next car, a remote detonator detonates a bomb that kills Greene.\""
