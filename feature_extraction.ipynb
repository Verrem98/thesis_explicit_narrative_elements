       "'Nolan is a man who suffers from severe amnesia due to a terrible car accident in which his wife lost her life. Despite severe memory problems, he continues to live with his baby daughter Ava, aided only by his best friend Gary, an orthopedic doctor. The man finds himself completely managed by his child and loses his job as a photojournalist because his shots are no longer up to his old works. Nolan also develops some characteristics that he never had in the past: he forgets to pick up his daughter from school and has small bouts of violence in which he loses control. He also begins to resent some of the rituals of his family routine that are dear to his daughter. In an attempt to regain his memory, Nolan, after several unsuccessful attempts with traditional medicine, begins experimental therapy with Dr. Brooks, who has developed a special hypnosis strategy that allows him to relive his most important memories.\\nNolan\\'s visions, however, are different from what he expected: the man sees places that seem familiar to him but that are different from those in which he has always lived, he cannot visualize the faces of the people with whom he interacts and above all he is attacked each time by an anthropomorphic creature that walks in a strange way, as if it were an animal. Each time the man awakens abruptly, however the doctor insists on continuing with the sessions: the woman claims that only by fighting that monster created by his mind will he be able to overcome his deficit, and that he will soon begin to visualize the faces of the people he loves. The further Nolan goes, however, the more he seems to see memories not of his own and begins to manifest attitudes different from those he had in the past. After focusing on the face of the woman he is marrying in his visions, Nolan is able to locate the apartment that appears in his memories. Recatovisi discovers that the woman in the vision is still alive and has a child of Ava\\'s age.\\nConcerned by his friend\\'s strange behavior, Gary discovers that Dr. Brooks was present when Nolan was taken to the hospital after the accident and that she had actually resuscitated him in her laboratory. At that very moment, during a longer session than usual, Nolan realizes that he is actually Thomas, the son of the doctor whose brain waves she had traced and saved before she died, and then implanted them into Nolan\\'s body when he was declared brain dead. Convinced with dismay that he has subjected that family to some violence, the man wants to make amends: so he entrusts Ava to Gary despite the protests of both of them and shows up at Miranda\\'s house. Here, wearing Nolan\\'s likeness, she introduces herself as a college classmate of Thomas\\'s, and after revealing the truth, the woman reacts with fear and dismay, thus prompting her husband to notice that all the photos of him have been removed from the apartment. Thomas then becomes violent and, when he pretends to go to his daughter\\'s room, Miranda stuns him. The man wakes up in front of Gary\\'s house, at the feet of his friend and Ava, but immediately runs away to go back to Dr. Brooks\\' office.\\nThe doctor subjects him to one last session with the aim of erasing from him the attacks of violence: in her vision she discovers with dismay that the anthropomorphic creature is actually what remains of Nolan. Brooks claims that this is only a projection of her mind and urges him to physically confront her: Nolan\\'s submissive nature prevents him from reacting, and so Thomas almost kills him. Just then, however, Ava and Gary burst into the lab: Nolan\\'s reaction to his daughter\\'s voice is confirmation to Thomas that the man is still alive and that his mother lied to him. Thomas is fought but, after remembering that he was killed by Miranda as he was about to attack their baby, decides to leave control of the body to its rightful owner: as soon as he wakes up, Nolan finally manages to perform his \"special greeting\" to Ava, and leaves with her and Gary. The latter destroys Brooks\\' equipment so that the doctor stops her experiments, after which the woman is discharged from the hospital.\\nNolan, Ava, Miranda and Gary all return to normal life, however Dr. Brooks continues from home to conduct her experiments on Thomas\\'s brain waves.'"
